# sinai
code and work performed in mt sinai


the attached files are designed to run munging and genetic correlation on multiple sets of sumstats in parallel in a european ancestry population on a slurm system with an ldsc conda env. 

The alternate flags denoted in some of the command calls (`--log10pvals`,`--rgdf`) were added by me by editing base ldsc code and can be found ![here](https://github.com/shaneoconnell1996/ldsc_edits)
